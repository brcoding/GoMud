Of course! I'd be happy to help you with rats in our MUD game. Here are some useful commands and information related to rats:

Commands:

* ` rat` - This command allows you to interact with any rat in the room. You can talk to it, feed it, or even pick a fight with it.
* `rat attack <target>` - This command allows you to attack a specific rat in the room. Make sure to specify the target rat by using the `<target>` tag.
* `rat eat <food>` - This command allows you to feed a rat in the room with a specific type of food. Use the `<food>` tag to specify the type of food you want to give the rat.
* `rat follow` - This command allows you to follow a rat in the room. It will lead you to the rat's nest, where you can find more information about it.

Information:

* Rats are neutral creatures that can be found in various rooms throughout the game world. They are usually located in dark, damp areas, such as caves or abandoned buildings.
* Rats have a simple AI and will typically run away if they sense danger. However, they can also be quite aggressive if they feel threatened or hungry.
* Rats are attracted to food, so leaving edible items in a rat's path can lead to interesting encounters.
* If you attack a rat, it may become hostile and attack you back. Be careful when interacting with rats, especially if you're not prepared for a fight.
* Rats have a unique ability called "burrowing" which allows them to dig into the ground and create hidden passages. This can be useful for escaping danger or finding hidden items.

I hope this information helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
