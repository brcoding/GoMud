Of course! I'd be happy to help you with currency in our MUD game. 

In our game, currency is known as "gold pieces" (GP). Players can earn gold by completing quests, selling items, and defeating enemies. Gold can be used to buy items from merchants, hire NPCs, and train skills.

There are several commands related to currency in our game:

* `withdraw` - Withdraw gold from your account
* `deposit` - Deposit gold into your account
* `balance` - View your current gold balance
* `transfer` - Transfer gold between characters

For example, to withdraw 10 GP from your account, you can use the command `withdraw 10`. To deposit 50 GP into your account, you can use the command `deposit 50`. To view your current balance, you can use the command `balance`.

Additionally, there are several skills related to currency in our game:

* `money` - Increases your earning potential from quests and selling items
* `selling` - Allows you to sell items for more gold than usual
* `trading` - Allows you to trade with other players for gold or items

For example, if you have the `money` skill at level 5, you will earn an additional 10 GP from completing quests and selling items. If you have the `selling` skill at level 3, you will be able to sell items for 15% more gold than usual.

I hope this information is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
