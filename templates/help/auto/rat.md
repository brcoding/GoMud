Of course! I'd be happy to help you with rat-related questions. Here are some possible questions and answers:

Q: How do I rat?
A: To rat, you can use the 'rat' command while in a room with an NPC or player that has something you want to steal. For example, if you want to steal an item from another player, you can type 'rat @player' and choose the item you want to take.

Q: What are some rat commands?
A: Some common rat commands include 'rat', 'rat @player', 'rat @npc', and 'rat @room'. These commands allow you to steal items from other players or NPCs in the room.

Q: How do I know what an NPC or player has in their inventory?
A: To see what an NPC or player has in their inventory, you can use the 'inspect' command followed by the NPC or player's name. For example, if you want to see what an NPC named "NPC1" has in their inventory, you can type 'inspect NPC1'.

Q: Can I rat from one room to another?
A: Yes, you can use the 'rat' command to steal items from one room to another. For example, if you are in one room and want to steal an item from another room, you can type 'rat @room' followed by the name of the item you want to take.

Q: How do I know if an NPC or player is carrying something valuable?
A: You can use the 'appraise' command to see what an NPC or player is carrying. For example, if you want to know what a player named "player1" is carrying, you can type 'appraise player1'. This will show you a list of any items the player has in their inventory.

I hope these answers are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions about rat commands or game mechanics.
