title: The East Gate
description: The mighty East Frostfang Gate stands as a formidable sentinel, marking the
  eastern entrance to the castle grounds. Crafted from massive slabs of dark, weathered
  stone, it's adorned with intricate carvings of ice dragons and winter warriors.
  Two imposing watchtowers flank the gate, their arrow slits ever vigilant. The gate
  itself, reinforced with iron and bearing the scars of past skirmishes, serves as
  both a welcoming point for allies and a stark deterrent for foes, embodying the
  resilience and legacy of Frostfang.
