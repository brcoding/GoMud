  description: 'At first glance, this appears to be a single gold coin lying on the ground. However, upon closer inspection, the coin reveals itself to be a small, metallic creature with a coin-like body. Its surface shimmers with a golden hue, and it has tiny, beady eyes that watch intently for potential victims. When threatened, the creature unfurls its body, revealing sharp, metallic appendages that it uses to attack.'
