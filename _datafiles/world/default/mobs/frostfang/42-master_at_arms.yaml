  name: master-at-arms
  description: 'The Master-at-Arms stands like a weathered oak in the training yard, his face a roadmap of scars from countless battles. His grizzled beard barely conceals a permanent scowl, and his eyes - one a piercing blue, the other milky from an old wound - scrutinize everyone for signs of weakness. Decades of combat have left his body hardened but twisted, with a pronounced limp that does nothing to diminish his imposing presence. His armor, though impeccably maintained, bears the dents and scratches of real combat rather than ceremonial use. When he speaks, his voice emerges as a gravelly growl, honed by years of shouting orders over the din of battle. Despite his intimidating demeanor and perpetual irritability, his training methods produce undeniably effective warriors, earning him grudging respect throughout Frostfang.'
