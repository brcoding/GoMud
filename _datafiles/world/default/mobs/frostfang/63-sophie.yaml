character:
  name: sophie
  description: Sophie is a young woman with chestnut hair tied back in a simple braid. She has a gentle face with warm brown eyes, though currently creased with worry. She wears a modest dress of blue wool, well-made but practical for Frostfang's cold climate. Her slender fingers keep reaching for her neck where a necklace would normally hang. Despite her obvious distress, she carries herself with quiet dignity, suggesting a resilient spirit beneath her current anxiety.
