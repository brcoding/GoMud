# GoMud

![image](feature-screenshots/splash.png)

GoMud is an in-development open source MUD (Multi-user Dungeon) game world and library.

It ships with a default world to play in, but can be overwritten or modified to build your own world using built-in tools.

## ANSI Colors

Colorization is handled through extensive use of my [github.com/GoMudEngine/ansitags](https://github.com/GoMudEngine/ansitags) library.

## Connecting

_TELNET_ : connect to `localhost` on port `33333` with a telnet client

_WEB CLIENT_: [http://localhost/webclient](http://localhost/webclient)

**Default Username:** _admin_

**Default Password:** _password_

## Env Vars

When running several environment variables can be set to alter behaviors of the mud:

- **CONFIG_PATH**_=/path/to/alternative/config.yaml_ - This can provide a path to a copy of the config.yaml containing only values you wish to override. This way you don't have to modify the original config.yaml
- **LOG_PATH**_=/path/to/log.txt_ - This will write all logs to a specified file. If unspecified, will write to _stderr_.
- **LOG_LEVEL**_={LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH}_ - This sets how verbose you want the logs to be. _(Note: Log files rotate every 100MB)_
- **LOG_NOCOLOR**_=1_ - If set, logs will be written without colorization.

# Why Go?

Why not?

Go provides a lot of terrific benefits such as:

- Compatible - High degree of compatibility across platforms or CPU Architectures. Go code quite painlessly compiles for Windows, Linux, ARM, etc. with minimal to no changes to the code.
- Fast - Go is fast. From execution to builds. The current GoMud project builds on a Macbook in less than a couple of seconds.
- Opinionated - Go style and patterns are well established and provide a reliable way to dive into a project and immediately feel familiar with the style.
- Modern - Go is a relatively new/modern language without the burden of "every feature people thought would be useful in the last 30 or 40 years" added to it.
- Upgradable - Go's promise of maintaining backward compatibility means upgrading versions over time remains a simple and painless process (If not downright invisible).
- Statically Linked - If you have the binary, you have the working program. Externally linked dependencies (and whether you have them) are not an issue.
- No Central Registries - Go is built to naturally incorporate library includes straight from their repos (such as git). This is neato.
- Concurrent - Go has concurrency built in as a feature of the language, not a library you include.

## Custom Configuration

To use the OpenAI API for LLM-powered features instead of local models:

1. Create a file named `_datafiles/config.custom.yaml` with your API configuration:

```yaml
Integrations:
  LLM:
    Enabled: true
    Provider: "openai"
    Model: "gpt-4.1-nano"  # Available models: gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4o, gpt-4.1-nano
    BaseURL: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
    Temperature: 0.7
    MaxContextLength: 10   # Maximum number of context messages to include
  
  LLMHelp:
    Enabled: true
    SystemPrompt: "You are a helpful MUD game assistant. Provide concise, accurate answers to player questions."
    EndpointURL: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
    APIKey: "your-api-key-here"  # Your OpenAI API key
    Model: "gpt-4.1-nano"        # Should match the model in LLM section above
    TemplatePath: "templates/help"
    SaveResponses: true          # Whether to save generated help responses as templates
```

2. Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

3. Understanding the configuration options:
   - **LLM section**: Controls general LLM features like NPC conversations
     - `Model`: Specify which OpenAI model to use (affects both capabilities and cost)
     - `BaseURL`: The base URL for the OpenAI API (usually keep as default)
     - `Temperature`: Controls randomness (0.0-1.0, higher = more creative/random)
   
   - **LLMHelp section**: Controls the help system specifically
     - `SystemPrompt`: Instructions for the AI when answering help questions
     - `EndpointURL`: The specific endpoint for chat completions
     - `APIKey`: Your OpenAI authentication key
     - `Model`: Which model to use for help responses
     - `SaveResponses`: Whether to cache responses to reduce API usage

4. Set the CONFIG_PATH environment variable to point to your custom config:

```bash
# On Linux/Mac:
export CONFIG_PATH=_datafiles/config.custom.yaml

# On Windows PowerShell:
$env:CONFIG_PATH="_datafiles/config.custom.yaml"

# On Windows Command Prompt:
set CONFIG_PATH=_datafiles/config.custom.yaml
```

5. Start the server with the environment variable set:

```bash
# Run directly with the environment variable set
CONFIG_PATH=_datafiles/config.custom.yaml go run .

# Or use the variable you exported earlier
go run .
```

6. This file is automatically added to `.gitignore` to prevent committing your API key to the repository.

7. Token usage tracking:
   - The system automatically tracks API usage per user
   - Players can view their token usage with the `status` command
   - Token costs are calculated based on the model used
